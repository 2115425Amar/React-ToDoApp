# React ToDo App

A simple task manager application built with React.js. This application allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

## Features

- **Task List**: Display a list of tasks with their titles and statuses (e.g., "To Do" and "Completed").
- **Add Task**: Implement a form to add new tasks with a title and description. New tasks appear in the task list.
- **Edit Task Status**: Allow users to change the status of a task between "To Do" and "Completed".
- **Delete Task**: Enable users to delete tasks from the list.
- **Styling**: Basic styling to make the application visually appealing and user-friendly.
